### Hey, I'm **Icy**!

# Introduction
I'm an aspiring Graphics programmer. I really, really love nature and how it interacts with itself. I'm also a big fan of simulating nature, and it's phenomenoms. Which is also a big reason on why I love graphics programming, since it lets me mix my 2 favorite things: programming and nature. Nature in video games always amazes me, one of the things that interests me is how it's optimized to run on consoles or lower end PCs. I also like watching GDC talks, since they really delve into how game mechanics work at a low level and they even inspire me to work on new projects. I'm also a big fan of FOSS, and people that contribute to it.

# My skills
Over the course of my journey I've babbled in quite a lot of programming languages, but the ones that I can confidently say that I know how to use are: **Python**, **Lua**, **JavaScript**/**TypeScript**, and some **C++**. Although, the ones I use the most and most proficiently are Python and Lua. I enjoy learning new things, especially in fields that I may not understand well.

Hopefully, this whole introduction gave you a new light on me and I'll see you in VS Code!
