### Hey, I'm **Icy**!
****
# Introduction
I'm a Devforum **Regular** and a **UGC creator**. I've got about **~4** years of experience in both **Modeling** and **Programming**. I love working with people and helping them understand areas of programming that they may not have known.
****
# My work
I mostly work on smaller projects, that try to push the capabilities of Roblox. To the point that Roblox itself is the limiting factor when I'm making projects. I always try making projects that are unique and that you may even find outside of Roblox.
****
# My skills
I also babble in programming outside of Roblox, such as **Python**, **JavaScript**/**TypeScript**, and minimal amounts of **C++**. Although, I mostly use Python. I enjoy learning new things, especially in fields that I may not understand well.

Hopefully, this whole introduction gave you a new light on me, and I'll see you in Studio!
